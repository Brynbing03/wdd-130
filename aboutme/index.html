        <p>Hello! My name is Brynlee Bingham. This is my first semester here at BYU-I, after transfering from the College of Southern Idaho. I am currently a software engineering major and I am excited to learn more about this field of study. Somethings that I love to do is play pickle ball, tennis and anything to do with the outdoors. I also love listening to and making music. I play the flute and a little bit of piano and ukulele.</p>
        <p>Web design has always intruigued me and so I wanted to learn more about it. I have a family friend who creates and is very involved in web design. Watching her has made me very curious and wanting to learn more. I hope that one day that I can be able to adequately create new and exciting things. My family owns and opperates our dairy farm and creamery and I would love to one day create a web page for our creamery and the products we sell. I think taking this course will help me be able to use my creativity in a unique and fun way!</p>
        <p>One of my favorite scriptures is in the Book of Mormon. It is Helaman 5:12 and it says "And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall." I love this scripture because it has always reminded me that if I am focused on my Savior Jesus Christ, that evrything will be okay. It gives me hope in knowing that as I build my foundation on Him, I can do great things!</p>
