        <p>Here at Pocket Ranch and Creamery, we strive to make it possible for all to be able to taste the delicious flavored milk we provide. We love to put a unique and fun spin on milk. Let's start at our roots, where our products come from. It all starts in the dirt on a 700 acre farm on the north side of a small farm town in Gooding, Idaho. Each Spring planting season starts and the Binghams are out there with the disk, harrow and planters. Through the Spring and into the Summer you get to watch the produce grow in order to feed the cows at the dairy. Although milk is our end product, it all started in the dirt. As crops are grown, harvested and fed to cows, miracles happen. Miraculously forage is converted to delicious milk that gets distributed and enjoyed to hundreds of households.Our cows are cared for daily with a huge amount of attention and care. From the fields to the milking parlor, we are able to get fresh creamy milk from all of our cows. After the milking process, the milk is brought into the creamery to be pasteurized, mixed and bottled so that everyone can taste the deliciousness. After the milk is brought into the creamery it is heated up and cooled down through a process called pasteurization. This process kills any harmful bacteria that can be found in the milk. It is then pumped into another holding vat where it will be connect4ed and brought to the bottler. The milk is then pumped into clean sterile bottles and capped so that it can be sold and shared with everyone. After being bottled, the milk is placed into crates and transported to a refrigerated trailer. It is then brought into the station, the Pocket Sinclaire to be sold. Anyone and everyone can come and taste this healthy goodness. This is how our farm fresh milk is transformed from a blade of grass to the delicious milk found in our station for all to enjoy.</p>
